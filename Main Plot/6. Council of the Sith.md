The castle ruins are an unnaturally quiet place, as the players enter they are assaulted by a whirlwind of dust.
# 1. Courtyard            Moderate 6
A [Mana Whorl](https://2e.aonprd.com/Hazards.aspx?ID=305) spanning the entire courtyard attacks the party. While the Mana Whorl exists the courtyard is hazardous terrain, dealing 1d4 force damage every 5 feet. One round in a non-hostile [[Bok the Ovinnik]] emerges from a dilapidated tower and strides into the middle of the courtyard before ending his turn. On the next round, if he is not attacked, he attempts to talk to the party welcoming them to his masters humble abode. He is not harmed by and does not acknowledge the threat of the Whorl. If he is attacked he defends himself to the best of his ability and flees to warn his master once reduced to half health.

His master is a [[Lady Grian Le Fae]], a Baobhan Sith.
